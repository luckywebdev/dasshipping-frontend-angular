try now
what? can't create table
wait, may be data was not stored to DB
do you know cred for any of those accounts?




do you need my assistance for now?
oh, thanks
just now I'll try myself


by the way can you explain again why db does not installed?

- first: PostgreSQL requires specific permissions for data folder. By default
Docker on Windows mounts data store as share - and it has no way to provide correct
permissions to data folder
I assigned dedicated local volume to PgSQL container
- then: by default PostgreSQL uses hba.conf to specify auth model used for different 
connections. It seems that app uses postgres user but no password was assigned to him
I changed auth model to trust - so anybody may connect to PgSQL in container w/o 
password

-----

I'll disconnect. Is it OK?
ok. so can I run the frontend with the backend?
you can restart both containers - they will keep current config. Or what
do you mean?

oh, I mean currently app container for the backend and db container run in docker
right?

db - yes. Let's check for app

Yes, TCP 3000 )node) and TCP 5432 (pg_sql) are in 
containers. 
ok good, so I can run frontend with these ?
right?
yes, it should work =) I mean: ok thanykou may start but it's necessary to view logs 

DB is able for connection via :5432 (take a look on pgAdmin - it's connected to the container)
app backend is also up but it may require some verification of valid work too.
May b some API tests via Postman for example


disconnecting, ping me in Slack 
ok thanks
great
